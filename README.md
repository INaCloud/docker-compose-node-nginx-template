Useful docker-compose template
=============================

Use docker to run a service ? Me, too!

But... the docker command is so complicated to remember

To run a nginx web server, you normally key in

`docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --restart always nginx`

Now, you can save your time by copying your favorite template here, then just

`docker-compose up`!
